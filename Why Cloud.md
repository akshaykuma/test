### Why Cloud?
---

An on-premise solution for an Organization is feasible only when they have a dedicated IT Staff who are well versed with Hardware, Software, deployment of Applications, patch management and various related tasks. On-premise also entails continuous maintenance & upgrades. There is also physical infrastructure cost to consider, the secure space (with lock & key) for hardware, power backup (UPS + Batteries), network infrastructure etc.

Any advanced software service today will typically have the following components
  - Proxy Server
  - Web Server
  - Application Server
  - Database Server
  - Backend jobs (scheduled / unscheduled) & 
  - Reporting Server
  
Each component has it's own technology stack and an Enterprise Level application would need all of these for a smooth, near 24X7 operation.

Contrary to popular belief the data in cloud is more secure than data in an on-premise system. The data in cloud is stored in highly secure data centres of Amazon, Microsoft, Google and such. For highly sensitive data, encryption tools are available. Any data in the cloud will be as safe as the data in say a gmail account. In addition to these, additional restrictions such as IP Based access, time-range access can be imposed to further restrict the access.

CampusTrack from the ground up has been designed to be cloud ready. It has the ability to release updates while the users are logged in into the system. This is done without disturbing their work. There are features such as tenanted databases that keep an organization's data in a separate database that is in-accessible from outside. Hardware & Software upgrades are carried out unobtrusively. Data back-up is automated with no additional effort from the organizational users.

Though it is possible to run CampusTrack on-premise, we do not advise our customers to do so unless they have a dedicated IT Staff with advance technical skills.
